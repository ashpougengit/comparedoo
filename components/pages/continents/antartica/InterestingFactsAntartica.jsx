                        **Coldest Place on Earth**: <br /> Antarctica holds the record for the coldest temperature ever recorded on
                        Earth, -128.6째F
                        (-89.2째C) at Vostok Station. This is much colder than Siberia, Russia, known for its severe winters.

                        **Size Comparison**: Antarctica is the fifth-largest continent, covering about 5.5 million square miles
                        (14.2 million
                        square kilometers), making it larger than Europe and almost twice the size of Australia.

                    <p>
                        **No Permanent Residents**: <br /> Unlike any other continent, Antarctica has no indigenous population or
                        permanent residents. The population consists of scientists and researchers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        **Ice Coverage**: <br /> Around 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice, which is the largest single mass of ice
                        on
                        Earth, containing about 70% of the world&apos;s fresh water.

                    <p>
                        **Desert Status**: <br /> Despite its ice, Antarctica is considered a desert because it receives very little
                        precipitation, comparable to the Sahara Desert.
                    </p>

                        Antarctica,
                        including the United States, Russia, and Argentina.

                    <p>
                        **Antarctic Treaty**: <br /> Signed by 54 countries, the Antarctic Treaty ensures that Antarctica is used
                        for
                        peaceful purposes and scientific research, with no military activity allowed.

                        **No Time Zones**: <br /> Antarctica does not have a specific time zone. Research stations use the time zone
                        of
                        their home country or supply base. So, in a way it has all the timezones in the world.

                        miles
                        (3,500 km), and it produces the largest icebergs in the world.

                        **Ozone Hole**: <br /> The discovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica in the 1980s led to international
                        agreements like the Montreal Protocol to reduce CFC emissions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        **Meteorites**: <br /> Antarctica is a prime location for finding meteorites because the ice preserves them,
                        and
                        the dark meteorites stand out against the white ice.

                        these
                        are held in abeyance under the Antarctic Treaty.
